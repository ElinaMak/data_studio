    "# Which are the States with the most natural disasters in the US?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is my question:\n",
    "\n",
    "-what kind of natural disasters exist in USA (fires, floods, tornados, mudslides, earthquakes, hurricanes etc)? Which ones are more frequent?\n",
    "\n",
    "-Are those areas populated?\n",
    "\n",
    "-If there is a type of a catastrophe that is a repeated phenomenon in a certain area / state? In that case, should there be state indemnity to compensate the losses of the local citizens? Should taxpayes pay for repeated catastrophic risks to people who insist living in an environment that they know for certain it will be destroyed?\n",
    "\n",
    "I created my own dataset. Although I checked for official statistics, at Disasters | Data.gov, the available datasets were not clear and when I tried to open the pdf's, I got always the message: \"Access denied\". I emailed the Agency but so far, I have no answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I contacted the Federal Emergency Management Agency where they gave me access to the database: \"Disaster declaration\". Μy first thought was to scrape the pages but soon I realized that some terms were unknown to me. For instance, fires are categorized, some have a cetain type and name, hurricanes have names and so on, so not clear which values go where to the pandas dataframe. Due to time considerations, I thought to limit my research only to the natural disasters DECLARED in 2018 and fall 2017. I ended up with 102 entries.\n",
    "While building the database, I had to search / google for the event in order to understand the type of disaster as in several cases the event is written in the examined database in the following manner: ex. Arizona 89 East Fire. Moreover, in some cases there were some numbers that I could not identify if it was a code for the state or the type of the disaster (ex. Texas 335 Fire (FM-5234)\n",
    "\n",
    "One should be carefull because some events happened in 2015 but \"declared\" (term used by the Agency) much later -months, or even years as it is the case for Alaska-.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the available findings, it seems that California has the most \"natural disasters\" and more specifically fires. Fire is also the most common type of disaster in USA for 2018 and part of 2017. \n",
    "\n",
    "It would have been nice to add the hectars that were destroyed and any sort of casualties for every disaster, as well as, the specific area in order to put it in a map.\n",
    "\n",
    "After cell 38 start the illustrations. Before, is just scraping. "
